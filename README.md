Meshery, is the open source, cloud native manager that enables the design and management of all Kubernetes-based infrastructure and applications. Among other features, As an extensible platform, Meshery offers visual and collaborative GitOps, freeing you from the chains of YAML while managing Kubernetes multi-cluster deployments. 
In this blog, we will discover give an introduction to service mesh and features Meshery has to offer, its architecture and a quick-guide to set it up.

## What is a Service Mesh?
Before diving into Meshery, let's briefly discuss what a service mesh is. A service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer that handles service-to-service communication within a microservices architecture. It is implemented as a sidecar proxy alongside each service instance and is responsible for routing, load balancing, authentication, and other network-related tasks.
Service meshes provide a way to decouple application logic from network infrastructure concerns. They also enable developers to implement complex traffic management patterns such as blue/green deployments, canary releases, and circuit breaking.

## What is Meshery?
Meshery is an open-source project developed by Layer5 that provides a vendor-agnostic platform for managing service meshes. It provides a unified interface for deploying and configuring multiple service mesh implementations, including Istio, Linkerd, Consul Connect, and more.
Meshery makes it easy to deploy and manage service meshes across multiple environments, from local development to production. It also provides a dashboard for monitoring the health and performance of your service mesh and microservices.

## Features
Meshery offers several features that can help you manage and monitor your service mesh, including:
### 1. Meshery Adapter Hub -
Meshery has a growing library of adapters that enable you to deploy and configure multiple service mesh implementations with ease.
### 2. Meshery Operator -
This operator allows you to easily install and manage Meshery on Kubernetes clusters.
### 3. Meshery CLI - 
This command-line interface enables you to deploy and configure service meshes and their components.
### 4. Service Mesh Performance - 
Meshery allows you to measure the performance of your service mesh and compare it against other service meshes.
### 5. Service Mesh Management - 
Meshery provides a centralized interface for managing multiple service meshes, including deploying and upgrading them.
### 6. Service Mesh Lifecycle - 
Meshery helps you manage the lifecycle of your service mesh, from development to deployment and monitoring.
